# BMI Body Mass Index

## Short Description
+ This Project is about calculating BMI ( Body mass index ) flutter application using a dart programming language.
+ This project takes height and weight as input and provides us with the exact result.

## Design
+ This BMI application is very simple and useful for calculating the height-weight ratio.
+ The text field should take input of weight and height.
+ The buttons are tappable and it should display the required result of the person This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Architecture
+ I have added AppBar which consists of the heading of BMI application.
+ In the body, I have used one BMI logo at the center.
+ Added three fields for entering:
  * Weight in Kg
  + Height in feet
  + Height in inch
  
+ Added a button at the end for calculating the required result.
